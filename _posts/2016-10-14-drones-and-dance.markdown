title: "A Thought About Drones & Dance Music"
categories: music culture
---

I've been trying (again) to find a way into dance music thanks to the tutelage of a friend who has dedicated himself to it. 
He's helped me begin to understand the functional and situational dimensions of dance music. I think these aspects of the music are very 
close to the practice of some drone and tone combination music. They both strike me as meditative practices -- some dance music maybe struggling to 
ride just above the simple heartbeat of the kick drum, just enough to carry the rhythm of the meditation along, invoking traditional idioms that 
erase the particulars of a song in a way and insert it into the larger fabric of the practice through history. Whereas in some drone & tone combination 
music there is a similar striving toward a total meditative stasis: a collapsing of the moment into a diamond point of space that struggles to strip away all 
signal and ride just above the stillness of the empty air, amplifying its presence. Both dilate the passage of time through some sort of meditative practice 
centered on activating the body and the mind.

See you at the club.
