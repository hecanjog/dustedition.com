If you came of age in 90s Wisconsin it was hard to not be touched by punk DIY culture. 
Midwestern culture is already primed for the ethos. “Hey no worries, I’ll do it myself” 
was as much a sentiment of politeness as it was one of anti-capitalism. My grandfather 
never really understood the music I make but he nurtured my DIY ethos passionately and 
understood its drive completely. His generation built things for themselves and tore 
apart the things they owned to improve them. He was an enthusiastic reader of the anarchist 
zine I self-published with some friends not just because he was an open-minded guy and 
loved to discuss the half-baked ideas we wrote about, but because self-publishing was 
the most natural thing in the world to him. I’m not sure he’d be able to recognize DIY 
culture as it is today – because it somehow has become something else entirely.

Capitalism has an amazing capacity to absorb dissenting ideology. If you told me twenty 
years ago that DIY culture and the proto-landscape of the web would be absorbed into toxic 
concepts like “content production” and “personal branding” I would have laughed in your face. 
Sitting here now it’s still hard to believe that the word “hacker” now means you’re seeking 
venture capital and “DIY” means buying shit at Ikea or the Make Magazine store and – gasp – 
using it for a slightly different purpose than intended.

Control of the means of production is still the best way to go about this kind of sea change. 
By looking at the way self-publishing has changed on the internet it is easy enough to see how 
the idea of “content production” has emerged in service to a wealthy minority of printing press 
owners. Self-publishing platforms of the 90s like Geocities were publically-available printing 
presses. They provided a blank and hackable canvas. They gave you tools to learn how the machinery 
underneath worked so that you could build your own printing press if you wanted to.

Self-publishing now looks like pasting “content” into a little box, which is analyzed in aggregate 
in order to determine how best to drive targeted advertising. It’s a kinda beautiful example of 
how capitalism absorbs ideology. The owner of the printing press doesn’t give a shit what you’re 
publishing of course, it’s in their best interest for you to feverishly publish whatever you like 
as long as you do it within a system that allows it to be monetized. This also allows modern 
publishing platforms to plausibly present the image that they’re just trying to enable communication, man.

So, what does it hurt anything? We still get tools to publish, who cares if the primary role 
of the printing press isn’t publication anymore? Just look at how it has transformed DIY ideology. 
People who aren’t simply consumers are “content producers” now. Fuck your goals and hopes and humanity, 
this says, you’re just a blip in the big data that becomes big money. We’re also groomed 
to think of ourselves in marketing terms (develop your personal brand!) and in doing so we identify 
with the owner of the printing press and normalize their behaviors. Hell, we model ourselves after them.

If anything about all this is encouraging it’s that the mechanisms of the new printing press owners 
are no longer entirely obscured. Even five years ago writing the above would probably be met with 
incredulousness. The cat is out of the bag at this point,  but it doesn’t quite matter as long as 
the momentum continues.

I’m hopeful that newer artist-first publishing platforms like Bandcamp and Drip will drive a 
wedge into cracks forming within the sickly DIY culture of today. They’re not solutions, but in 
them I feel like I see a way forward.

So keep supporting DIY culture. Say fuck off to Spotify and iTunes, buy some music directly from 
an artist, and maybe we’ll sway this lumbering giant of ideology back onto a better path one day.
